initSidebarItems({"fn":[["acpi_table_handler","The single arbiter of ACPI Table types,  which contains a large table of ACPI signatures to specific table handler functions.  Each handler invoked by this function will add the specific table to the given list of `AcpiTables`. # Arguments * `acpi_tables`: a mutable reference to the `AcpiTables` that will contain the new table.  * `signature`: the signature of the ACPI table that is being added.     This determines which handler is invoked. * `length`: the total length of the table, which was obtained from its `Sdt` header when originally mapped. * `phys_addr`: the `PhysicalAddress` of the table, which is used for determining where it exists within the mapped region."]]});
