# Theseus Documentation 

Welcome to the online hosted docs for Theseus! This is currently a work in progress. 

The [top-level Theseus README](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/blob/theseus_main/README.md) is most up-to-date and a great place to get started. 

[The main source-level documentation is available here](./doc/___Theseus_Crates___/index.html).

[A higher-level overview of Theseus is available here as book-style documentation](./book/index.html).
